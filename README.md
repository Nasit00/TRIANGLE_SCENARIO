# TRIANGLE_SCENARIO
This project provides a Python class n_dimensional_Vector that represents vectors in any dimension. It supports essential vector operations like addition, dot product, cross product (3D), equality check, and cloning, making it useful for learning object-oriented programming and mathematical computations in Python.
